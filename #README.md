# Profile page

My goal in this project were to make a profile webpage that will display my web applications that I personally made. However, I do not have any applications that I made prior to this challenge. I wanted my webpage to be able to function and display propertly on multiple devices. Including flexbox and media queries took my webpage to a different level, because I was able to align the multiple sections correctly. Even though I that I could have done 100x better, this has given me the confidence to keep striving forward. 

Working on this assignment has helped me become more familiar with the advanced CSS. Even though I struggled a lot in this assignement, it made me realise that I can be successful if I put the time in. I was able to navigate throughout my webpage with the appropiate styling links.
